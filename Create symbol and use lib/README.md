As this symbol is quite ugly for a fet we create a new symbol for it.  
In the location /This PC/Documents/LTspiceXVII/lib/sym/AutoGenerated a file called SCT3160KL_LT.asy is available. 
Rename SCT3160KL_LT.asy to SCT3160KL_LT.asy.old  

Copy the nmos.asy from the location where LTspice is installed C:\Program Files\LTC\LTspiceXVII\lib\sym  
Rename the file to SCT3160KL_LT.asy  
Move the .asy and .lib to a location on the harddisc where the custom library is stored, the .lib must be stored in the folder called sub
